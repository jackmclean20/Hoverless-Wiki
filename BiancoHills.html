<p id="long"><b>Waterslide Mechanics:</b><p>
<p id="long">To start you will need to get a waterslide, which is normally done via a hoverslide. 
<u>However, since this is hoverless, we cannot do that!</u>
<br>Instead, you can do a small jump as soon as possible while holding R and forward, and then right before Mario lands, 
do a spam spray and dive into the water. <br>If done ideally, as Mario reaches the peak of the hill, your max speed can reach <b>~83</b>, 
but it will usually be in the <b>70s</b>, which is still 100% acceptable, along with some <b>60s</b>, but the lower speed means the poorer waterslide.

</div>

<p id="long"><br>If you have sufficient speed, you will not lose much speed as you reach the peak, before it starts to increase again by sliding down the downwards slope ahead. 
<br><u>If you start to lose a lot of speed at the peak because you did not get a good waterslide</u>, 
you can do a rollout when your speed is really low,<br> and then set up another waterslide past the peak, when the slope is downhill.

</div>

<p id="long"><u><br>If you completely miss the waterslide</u>, you can just do jumpdives and rollouts until you are past the peak of the hill, and then set up a waterslide for the downhill.

<p id="long">There are two directions that you can approach this waterslide from. 
The standard, straight-forward method on the stone path as mentioned above, or you can use the grass. 
<br>Traditionally, the stone path <b>(left side)</b> has always been used, but using the grass <b>(right side)</b> has been concluded to save <b>~0.3</b> seconds. 
<br>For the right side, immediately after starting the waterslide, you want to slide a bit to the right, and aim for this area outlined with the red square.

  </div>
 </div>

<p id="long"><br>I usually do this by wiggling the stick between <b>up and up-right</b>, and turning the camera a bit to the left. 
<br>If you get onto the grass too early, you will likely slide back off onto the stone path, to which you can continue with the left side strat. 
<br>If you try to get onto the grass too late, you will just stay on the stone path and slide against the wall beneath the grass floor, to which you can also continue with the left side strat.

<p id="long"><br>If you do successfully get the grass slide, try to follow the path shown, avoiding the steep green grass slope against the wall (with X marks) as much as you can.</p>

<p id="long"><br>Next, you will rollout onto this grass wall thing, making sure to either go <u>before you reach the windmill in the grass, or go far to the right</u>, since this windmill has a much wider hitbox than what is visible.

 </div>

<p id="long"><br>From here, you can do a spinjump-dive onto the top of the white wall, into a rollout to make it past the gap. 
Make sure that your angle is not <b>too far to the right</b>, or else you will bonk against the wall.

 </div>

<p id="long"><u><br>If you are too far back before the rollout</u>, you can delay the dive so that you get closer to the edge, 
or else you will ledge grab the wall on the other side of the gap. <br><u>For the left side strat</u>, you can rollout from your waterslide to land a bit past the shadows of these tree leaves, 
to which you can spinjump-dive onto the windmill, and rollout onto the white stone wall, holding right to make it if needed.

<div>
<center>
<img src="videos/bh/ep2/paragraph 2/image6.png" style="width:520px; height:300px;">

</div>

<p id="long"><br>From here, if you hold between the <b>up and up-left notches</b>, you can do a jumpdive to land right before the archway. 
<br>You can turn your camera to the right mid-air, and then rollout while holding R, and then do a medium-sized jump to get water on the top of the archway, as well as onto the grass on the other side. 
<br>Next, you can do a dive <b>(once youâ€™ve delayed it enough to make sure the water lands on the grass too)</b> into the water you just sprayed to waterslide from the peak of the arch until youâ€™re off the wall. 
<br>Since there should be water on the grass from when you set up the waterslide on the arch, you can dive into it right before you touch the ground, and waterslide ahead.

<img src="videos/bh/ep2/paragraph 3/image 1.png" style="width:520px; height:300px;">
</div>

<p id="long"><u><br>If there is no water for you on the grass</u>, you can do a spam spray as you slide off the wall, and another right before you land, then dive into that water. 
Alternatively, you can spray some when you land and then dive into it from there. Oftentimes, I do the spam sprays regardless of if there is water or not, since it looks cool, 
and is not a bad habit to have for when the water is actually missing.<br>
</p>

<p id="long"><br>Next, you can slide between this sign and the goop ahead. 
The sign has a hitbox much <b>larger than what you can see</b>, which you can bonk into, and the goop on the right slows you down almost every single time. 
<u>If you aim for the middle of them</u>, and hold towards <b>up-left</b> as you approach it to account for the slope before them, then you can pass through without issue.

<p id="long">
For the spider, <u>every time that Mario makes a splash in the water, it swims in a straight line toward where Mario is</u>, whenever it is ready to attack. 
<br>A splash is made every time that Mario lands in or jumps out of water, which means that you can swim without creating a splash, to better position yourself. 
<br>Additionally, the spider has a cooldown to which he can attack the splash position, which is also important to keep in mind. 
<br>This can be kept in mind to lure the spider in a slightly different direction.<br>
<br>In this example, if I demonstrate that the spider attacks because of the splash, but he attacks where Mario is once he is ready to attack. 
<br>Because of where I did the groundpound, he would attack me in a straight line passing through my position, but if I didnâ€™t do the groundpound, I would be in a slightly different position, that he would pass through instead.
